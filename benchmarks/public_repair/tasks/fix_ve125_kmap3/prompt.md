I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - input  c
 - input  d
 - output out

The module should implement the Karnaugh map below. d is don't-care,
which means you may choose to output whatever value is convenient.

              ab
   cd   01  00  10  11
   00 | d | 0 | 1 | 1 |
   01 | 0 | 0 | d | d |
   11 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
   10 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

The module must be named `TopModule`. Provide synthesizable SystemVerilog only; no testbench or simulation system tasks belong in the submitted RTL.


The RTL file provided in this workspace was written for the specification above but contains a functional defect. Repair it so that it fully meets the specification. Keep the module name and ports. Do not rewrite unrelated logic.
